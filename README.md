# ME2011-TA
## This program uses fuzzywuzzy python library for reading online class attendance for repeated meetings or courses from Zoom registration reports.

Data not attached to the repository since it is protected by US HEPA. The code reads csv registration reports of weekly zoom meetings for the ME2011 course at UMN, compares the attendance of individual students enrolled in the course, and outputs a csv file that shows the attendance percentage of each student.
This program was then used to calculate the Attendance Grade that was 5% of the entire course points.
